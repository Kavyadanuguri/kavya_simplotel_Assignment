You are required to create a responsive webpage using plain HTML and CSS (no frameworks or libraries like Bootstrap or Material-UI are allowed). The webpage must support desktop, tablet, and mobile views and should be fully responsive at different zoom levels and window sizes. The design and color scheme need to match a given design.

### **Key Tasks:**

1. **Matching the Design:**
    - Your webpage must look identical to the provided design.
    - Pay close attention to the color scheme, fonts, and layout specifics.
2. **Responsiveness:**
    - Ensure the webpage is responsive, adapting seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.
    - The layout should change appropriately (using CSS media queries) to offer a good user experience on all devices.
3. **Image Handling:**
    - Images should not appear pixelated or stretched at any screen size.
    - Properly handle image resolutions and aspect ratios.
4. **Behavior During Zoom and Resize:**
    - The webpage must maintain its layout without breaking when zoomed in or out.
    - Test how components rearrange and resize when the browser window is expanded or shrunk.
5. **Text Management:**
    - Ensure that text does not overflow out of its containers.
    - Handle different lengths of content gracefully, ensuring readability and proper alignment.

### **Important Notes:**

- **Delivery:**
    - Submit a live link to your project by the specified deadline.
    - Adherence to the design, responsiveness, and attention to detail will be key criteria for evaluation.

### **References Context:**

1. **HTML Basics:**
    - Start by structuring your HTML content according to the design. Use appropriate tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.
2. **CSS Fundamentals:**
    - Style your HTML elements using CSS.
    - Example techniques include Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout management.
  
3. **Responsiveness:**
    - Use media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes.
    - Example media query for mobile first approach:
        
        ```css
        @media (min-width: 768px) {
            /* Styles for tablets and up */
        }
        @media (min-width: 1024px) {
            /* Styles for desktops and up */
        }
        
        ```
        
4. **Testing and Debugging:**
    - Test your website on different devices and browsers.
    - Check how it behaves when resized or zoomed.
